# dinner-randomizer

## Freeflow
This simple app allows a user to enter the name of a recipe.
There should be a button that when clicked, randomizes the list of recipes and selects one
per day.

There is one recipe per day.

There are 7 days.

This is the MVP.

## Fields needed
1 input field to add the name of a recipe

A list of recipes

A table that shows Monday through Sunday and 1 of the recipes from the list.


Actions
 - Add a recipe
 - Edit a recipe: The easiest way is just to show the list of recipes and allow the user to edit the name.
 - Delete a recipe: Place an X, when user clicks on it, a modal appears asking if they are sure. Delete if true


 X : Name of Recipe
